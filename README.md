In this project we experimented with self balancing-robots that use the two wheeled inverted pendulum TWIP system. This project's objective is to stabilize the robot in a closed loop using the PID(Proportional-Integral-Derivative) regulator . We started with a simplified mathematical model of the system to understand the model's requirements and challenges .
