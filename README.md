In this project we experimented with self balancing-robots that use the two wheeled inverted pendulum TWIP system. This project's objective is to stabilize the robot in a closed loop using the PID(Proportional-Integral-Derivative) regulator . We started with a simplified mathematical model of the system to understand the model's requirements and challenges .

We proceeded to the conception of the robot using the Arduino Uno card , the MPU 6050 sensor and other electrical components. The electrical wiring of the robot is as such :

This is a picture of the prototype we created :

Then we proceeded to implementing the PID regulator with an Arduino code .

Below is a a bloc diagram detailing the overall fuction of the regulator :

We implemented the same regulator in LabView in order to visualise in real-time the variation of the error in the system , we also created a LabvView graphical interface for better visualization.
